Detailed File References (for endpoints with 2+ usages):
  No unused endpoints have multiple file references.

Note: This script searches for endpoint usage in multiple patterns:
      1. Exact string matches: ""
      2. Method calls: .GET(""), .POST(""), etc.
      3. Path parameters: {id} matches actual values like 123, abc, etc.
      The API spec file is automatically excluded from the search results.
