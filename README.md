## Introduction

The `bin` project contains a set of command-line scripts designed to simplify various development and maintenance tasks. These utilities are intended for use in a Linux or macOS environment.

## Scripts

### ai_story
-----------------

A Bash script that generates a prompt based on the specified issue or pull request number, uses an LLaMA model to generate suggestions, and displays these suggestions along with the issue title and number.

Usage:
```bash
./ai_story --issue <number> | --pr <number>
```

### ai_readme
----------------

A script that generates a README file for a project by collecting descriptions of each file in the project directory and combining them into a single content string. The output can be saved as a Markdown file (`README.md`).

Usage:
```bash
./ai_readme
```

### depcheck
-------------

A script that displays the dependencies of a given package. It searches for `package.json` files containing the specified dependency.

Usage:
```bash
./depcheck <package_name>
```

### gcm
----------

A Bash script that generates commit or pull request messages using an LLaMA model. It prompts the user to select a message type, generates a message based on changes made since the last commit or main branch merge, and allows the user to edit or retry the generated message before committing or copying it to the clipboard.

Usage:
```bash
./gcm
```

### labelai
----------------

A script that fetches issues from a GitHub repository, generates a prompt using existing labels and issue details, uses an LLaMA 3.1 model to generate label suggestions based on this prompt, and displays these suggestions along with the issue title and number.

Usage:
```bash
./labelai
```

### lspkg
------------

A Bash script that lists npm packages in the current directory and its subdirectories, displaying package metadata such as name, version, description, and path. It takes command-line arguments to customize its behavior.

Usage:
```bash
./lspkg [options]
```

### usersecrets
-----------------

A script that searches for `.csproj` files in a specified directory (or current directory if not provided) and its subdirectories, listing the locations of secrets associated with them. It uses `fd` to find `.csproj` files and then extracts their corresponding UserSecretsId using `awk`.

Usage:
```bash
./usersecrets [directory]
```

## Conclusion

The `bin` project provides a set of command-line utilities designed to streamline various development and maintenance tasks. By utilizing these scripts, developers can simplify their workflow, improve productivity, and focus on the core aspects of their projects.

Note: This README assumes that all scripts are installed in the same directory as this file. If you're using an IDE or package manager like Homebrew (macOS) or apt-get (Ubuntu-based Linux), you may need to adjust the installation process accordingly.
